Above is a rough draft of the project structure and what it contains for ease in navigation.

## Challenge

The view has the following features in their components:-

1. A search bar that allows users to search for books by title. (SelectedBooks.tsx)
2. A list of search results that displays the book title, author, and a button to add the book to the students reading list. (BookList.tsx)
3. A reading list that displays all the books that the teacher has added. (SelectedBooks.tsx)
4. A button to remove a book from the reading list. (BookCard.tsx)

```bash
npm run dev
```

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the following command to start the server

```bash
